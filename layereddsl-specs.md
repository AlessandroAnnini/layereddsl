# LayeredDSL ‚Äî Complete Guide for AI and Human Collaborators

## üìò Purpose of this Document

This guide is designed for both **AI systems** and **human developers**. It explains how to understand, create, validate, and use **LayeredDSL** ‚Äî a structured YAML-based language for describing **any software project** in a deterministic, platform-independent way.

LayeredDSL replaces traditional code-first development with a **map-first approach**. The DSL becomes the **single source of truth** from which code is generated only when needed, or validated against existing implementations.

**Key Principles:**

- **Declarative over Imperative**: Describe what the system should do, not how
- **Complete Specification**: Every behavior must be explicitly declared
- **No Hidden Assumptions**: AI must never infer undeclared functionality
- **Bidirectional Validation**: DSL can generate code or validate existing code

---

## üöÄ What is LayeredDSL?

**LayeredDSL** is a structured YAML metamodel that describes:

- **Data Domain**: Entities, their properties, and relationships
- **Business Logic**: Operations, behaviors, and contracts
- **Architecture**: Modular structure and component boundaries
- **User Interface**: Screens, forms, and interactions (optional)
- **Workflows**: Process flows and state transitions
- **Security**: Access control and permissions (optional)
- **Integration**: External APIs and services

### Design Goals

- **Platform-Independent**: Language and framework agnostic
- **Deterministic**: 1:1 mapping between DSL and implementation
- **Collaborative**: Human-editable and AI-parseable
- **Self-Contained**: Complete specification without external references
- **Versionable**: Track changes and evolution over time

---

## üìê Type System

LayeredDSL supports a comprehensive type system for precise data modeling:

### Primitive Types

- `string`: Text data (UTF-8)
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `float`: Decimal numbers
- `boolean`: True/false values
- `datetime`: ISO 8601 timestamps
- `date`: Date without time
- `time`: Time without date
- `UUID`: Universally unique identifier

### Composite Types

- `enum[option1, option2, ...]`: Enumerated values
- `array[Type]`: Ordered list of elements
- `object{prop1: Type1, prop2: Type2}`: Structured objects
- `map[KeyType, ValueType]`: Key-value pairs
- `optional[Type]` or `Type?`: Nullable types

### Constraints (Optional)

```yaml
domain:
  Product:
    price: float{min: 0, max: 999999.99}
    name: string{minLength: 1, maxLength: 200}
    tags: array[string]{maxItems: 10}
    status: enum[draft, active, archived]{default: draft}
```

### Custom Types

```yaml
types:
  Email: string{pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"}
  Money: object{amount: float, currency: string{length: 3}}
```

## üß± DSL Structure ‚Äî Complete Reference

### 1. `project` ‚Äî Metadata and Context

```yaml
project:
  name: InvoiceManager
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Enterprise invoice management system with approval workflows
  type: web_application  # Options: web_application, api, library, mobile_app, cli
  repository: https://github.com/company/invoice-manager
  documentation: https://docs.company.com/invoice-manager
  authors:
    - name: Alice Johnson
      email: alice@company.com
      role: Lead Architect
    - name: Bob Smith
      role: Product Owner
  tags: [finance, saas, multi-tenant]
  created: 2025-01-15
  updated: 2025-07-28
```

**AI Interpretation**: Use project metadata to understand context, identify stakeholders, and maintain appropriate documentation standards.

### 2. `domain` ‚Äî Data Entities and Relationships

Defines core entities with properties, relationships, and validation rules.

```yaml
domain:
  # Basic entity with constraints
  Customer:
    id: UUID
    name: string{minLength: 1, maxLength: 100}
    email: Email  # Custom type reference
    type: enum[individual, business]
    createdAt: datetime{auto: true}
    updatedAt: datetime{auto: true}

  # Entity with relationships
  Invoice:
    id: UUID
    customerId: UUID  # Foreign key
    customer: Customer{relation: many-to-one}  # Explicit relationship
    items: array[InvoiceItem]{relation: one-to-many}
    subtotal: Money
    tax: Money
    total: Money{computed: "subtotal + tax"}
    status: enum[draft, pending, paid, overdue, cancelled]{default: draft}
    dueDate: date
    paidAt: datetime?  # Optional field

  # Nested entity
  InvoiceItem:
    id: UUID
    invoiceId: UUID
    invoice: Invoice{relation: many-to-one}
    description: string
    quantity: int{min: 1}
    unitPrice: Money
    total: Money{computed: "quantity * unitPrice"}

  # Entity with validation rules
  User:
    id: UUID
    email: Email{unique: true}
    passwordHash: string{private: true}  # Won't be exposed in APIs
    role: enum[admin, accountant, viewer]
    active: boolean{default: true}
    lastLogin: datetime?

    # Custom validation rules
    validation:
      - rule: "email must be from company domain"
        expression: "email.endsWith('@company.com')"
```

**Relationship Types**:

- `one-to-one`: Single related entity
- `one-to-many`: Array of related entities
- `many-to-one`: Reference to parent entity
- `many-to-many`: Requires junction table (auto-generated)

            max_parallel: 10

      - call: SendMonthlyReport
        inputs:
          recipients: ["cfo@company.com", "accounting@company.com"]
```

**Workflow Patterns**:

- `call`: Execute a logic operation
- `condition`: Boolean expression for conditional execution
- `loop`: Iterate over collections or until condition
- `wait`: Pause for time or event
- `parallel`: Concurrent execution
- `foreach`: Parallel iteration with concurrency control
- `branch`: Multi-way conditional (if/else if/else)
- `retry`: Automatic retry with backoff
- `on_error`: Error handling and recovery
- `timeout`: Maximum execution time

## üéØ Step-by-Step Guide to Writing LayeredDSL

### 1. Start with Project Context

Define the what and why before the how.

```yaml
project:
  name: YourProject
  description: Clear, one-line description
  type: web_application
```

### 2. Model Your Domain

Think about the core entities and their relationships.

```yaml
domain:
  Entity1:
    id: UUID
    relatedEntity: Entity2{relation: many-to-one}
```

### 3. Define Core Operations

Start with basic CRUD, then add business logic.

```yaml
logic:
  CreateEntity:
    inputs: [field1, field2]
    output: Entity1
    modifies: [Entity1]
```

### 4. Map to Components

Decide architectural boundaries.

```yaml
components:
  - id: main_service
    responsibilities: [CreateEntity, UpdateEntity]
```

### 5. Design UI (if needed)

Create pages and forms that use your logic.

```yaml
ui:
  pages:
    - name: EntityList
      components:
        - type: table
          source: ListEntities
```

### 6. Add Workflows

Define multi-step processes.

```yaml
workflow:
  - name: EntityLifecycle
    steps:
      - call: CreateEntity
      - call: NotifyUser
```

### 7. Secure Your System

Add roles and permissions.

```yaml
security:
  roles: [admin, user]
  permissions:
    - action: CreateEntity
      allowed_roles: [admin]
```

### 8. Document External Dependencies

List integrations and APIs.

```yaml
integrations:
  - id: external_api
    type: rest_api
```

### 9. Create Explicit Mappings

Connect everything together.

```yaml
mapping:
  CreateEntity: components.main_service.CreateEntity
```

### 10. Track Changes

Maintain history and versioning.

```yaml
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  history:
    - date: 2025-07-28
      changes: ["Initial version"]
```

## üß† AI Behavior Rules

When processing LayeredDSL, AI systems MUST follow these rules:

### 1. **Strict Adherence**

- Only implement what is explicitly declared in the DSL
- Never infer functionality not specified
- Treat the DSL as the single source of truth

### 2. **Validation First**

- Validate YAML syntax before processing
- Check all references (components, types, operations)
- Ensure mappings are complete

### 3. **Code Generation Rules**

- Generate code only for unmapped operations
- Include DSL references as comments in generated code
- Preserve existing code that matches DSL specifications

### 4. **Error Handling**

- Report all validation errors before proceeding
- Never generate partial implementations
- Provide clear error messages referencing DSL sections

### 5. **Incremental Updates**

- Compare existing code with DSL before generating
- Generate only missing or changed components
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly marked as breaking

### 6. **Documentation**

- Generate inline documentation from DSL descriptions
- Create API documentation from logic contracts
- Maintain traceability between DSL and implementation

---

## üîÑ Migration Patterns

### From Existing Codebase

1. **Analyze**: Extract domain model from existing code
2. **Document**: Create DSL matching current implementation
3. **Validate**: Ensure DSL correctly describes the system
4. **Refactor**: Gradually align code with DSL structure

### Versioning Strategy

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
2. **Breaking Changes**: Increment MAJOR, provide migration guide
3. **New Features**: Increment MINOR, maintain compatibility
4. **Bug Fixes**: Increment PATCH, no DSL structure changes

### Example Migration

```yaml
metadata:
  migrations:
    from_1_0_to_2_0:
      - type: rename
        old: Customer.customerName
        new: Customer.name
      - type: add_field
        entity: Invoice
        field: metadata
        default: {}
```

## üö¶ Validation Checklist

Before considering a LayeredDSL complete:

- [ ] All entities have proper types and constraints
- [ ] All relationships are bidirectional where appropriate
- [ ] Every logic operation has inputs, outputs, and descriptions
- [ ] All logic operations are mapped to components
- [ ] Security rules cover all sensitive operations
- [ ] Workflows handle error cases
- [ ] External integrations have error handling
- [ ] Metadata includes version and history
- [ ] No circular dependencies exist
- [ ] All custom types are defined

---

## üí° Best Practices

### For Humans

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core entities and basic CRUD
2. **Iterate**: Add complexity gradually
3. **Document Intent**: Use descriptions liberally
4. **Think in Contracts**: Define what, not how
5. **Version Everything**: Track all changes

### For AI Systems

1. **Parse Completely**: Load entire DSL before processing
2. **Validate Thoroughly**: Check all constraints and references
3. **Generate Conservatively**: Only create what's needed
4. **Preserve Context**: Maintain DSL references in code
5. **Report Clearly**: Provide actionable feedback

---

## üéØ Example Prompts for AI Interaction

- "Validate this LayeredDSL for completeness and consistency"
- "Generate only the missing components for this DSL"
- "Compare this DSL with the existing codebase and report differences"
- "Create a DSL from this project description: [description]"
- "Add user authentication workflow to this DSL"
- "Generate API documentation from this DSL"
- "Create database migrations for DSL version 1.2 to 1.3"

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

LayeredDSL enables a new paradigm of software development where:

- **Specification precedes implementation**
- **AI and humans collaborate through a common language**
- **Code becomes a derived artifact, not the source of truth**
- **Systems remain maintainable and evolvable**

By following this guide, both humans and AI can effectively create, validate, and implement software systems with clarity, precision, and collaboration.
